Setting Up CloudAssets at Home as a user.

Installing CloudTools will give you a Maya tab that lets you access the tools I’ve written for your project.

Install the toolset by copying and pasting the following into a Python box in the maya script editor:

#start here
import maya.cmds as m
import sys
import os
filename = m.fileDialog2(fileMode=1, caption="INIT.txt")[0]
path = filename.replace("CT_Public/INIT.txt","")
sys.path.append(path+"CT_Public/")
import cTools.setup
reload( cTools.setup)
if m.window("resetShelf_WIN",q=True,ex=True):
	m.deleteUI("resetShelf_WIN")
m.window("resetShelf_WIN",height = 50,width=150)
m.columnLayout(adjustableColumn=True)
m.button("resetShelf",c="CT_Obj = cTools.setup.sceneSetup('"+path+"');m.deleteUI(('resetShelf_WIN'))")
m.showWindow("resetShelf_WIN")
#end here

This should prompt you to open a file.  Find the INIT.txt file (it’s in the ‘Public’ folder, which should be visible once you click on the google drive shortcut on your desktop) and click ‘open’.

If everything worked, you should get a confirmation dialog box saying so, and a new tab titled ‘CloudTools’ should appear.  If at anytime the scripts stop working, redo the above procedure to reinstall the shelf.

Configuring your scene:

Click on the little ID card icon on the left side of the shelf to setup your scene.  It will prompt you for a role and a shot.  Enter these when prompted and the logo should turn green.  Once it does, you’re all setup and tools that I develop will know what you are working on and what shot you’re in.



Incremental save:

In order to save increments, first setup your scene (see above).  Once this is done, just click on the disk logo and enter a comment.  Everytime you click ‘save’, the tool saves two files.  One ‘root’ file in the Anim folder, and a commented increment in the ‘Anim/Wrk’ folder.
