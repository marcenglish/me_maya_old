Setting Up CloudAssets at Home as admin:

Note - This has only been tested on a Windows box with Dropbox and Google Drive so far, so installation notes are based on one of these setups.

1 - Download the desktop app for the cloud service.  Dropbox and Google Drive both have one.  This app will create a syncing mirror of your cloud storage in your folder sructure.

2 - Place 'CloudTools' in this folder.

3 - Add your workstation login next to 'admin=' in the CloudTools/CT_Admin/config.txt

4 - Install the toolset by executing the following in maya:

#start here
import maya.cmds as m
import sys
import os
						
filename = m.fileDialog2(fileMode=1, caption="INIT.txt")[0]
path = filename.replace("CT_Public/INIT.txt","")
sys.path.append(path+"CT_Public/")
import cTools.setup
reload( cTools.setup)
if m.window("resetShelf_WIN",q=True,ex=True):
	m.deleteUI("resetShelf_WIN")
m.window("resetShelf_WIN",height = 50,width=150)
m.columnLayout(adjustableColumn=True)
m.button("resetShelf",c="CT_Obj = cTools.setup.sceneSetup('"+path+"');m.deleteUI(('resetShelf_WIN'))")
m.showWindow("resetShelf_WIN")
#end here


5 - Run projectSetup to create the folder structure for your project.

6 - Click on the reload button (Cloud icon with a refresh arrow) to reload the CloudTools object.

7 - You're done!  You can use the scene setup tool (ID card icon) to setup your maya environment and start working.
